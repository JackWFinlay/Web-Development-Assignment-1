				<li>I attempted to use the Bootstrap framework, but found that it didn't really add anything I couldn't just do myself. I also found that it would not allow me to really show off my skills in CSS as most of it is already done by the framework.</li>
				<li>I had trouble getting some of the database stuff to work. I have not worked with a MySQL database or PHP before, so it was an interesting challenge.</li>
				<li>I would like to make a much better looking site, with better styling and a more interesting layout.</li>
				<li>I have used the following resources:
					<ul>
						<li>The lecture slides.</li>
						<li>
							<a href="http://w3schools.com" target="_blank">w3schools.com
							</a>
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="http://stackoverflow.com" target="_blank">stackoverflow.com
							</a>
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="http://php.net" target="_blank">php.net
							</a>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Although I have quite a lot of experience with web development I found that I still learned a lot. There were things that I did not know about, such as the reset input element, and how to connect a database to a webpage in PHP. I also learned how to use PHP, I have previous experience with ASP.NET MVC and so it was quite an interesting change.</li>
